My passion is to express myself in math, science, and statistics, and I am excited to explore the vast array of technologies that can create a beneficial impact in the future.
<br/>

I want to take on new challenges with colleagues with new perspectives in a vibrant community.
<br/>

I enjoy playing basketball, solving Rubik's Cubes, and listening to music. I love exploring the world of painting, designing issues as editor of a school magazine, and interacting with my community friends.
