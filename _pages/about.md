I am
<br/>

Minki Shin
<br/>

A data scientist and researcher. Inspired by real world problems. 
<br/>

My passion is working with hidden pattern recognition, data mining and visualization in order to develop software and hardware tools that help empower those in need. 
<br/>

I am looking to begin my undergraduate study in Applied Math and Statistics. I am excited about tackling new challenges with colleagues of new perspectives in a vibrant community.
<br/>

**A Data Scientist**
<br/>

I am a self-learned expert in machine learning and big data analysis in various backgrounds including medical image, social media texts, and natural language in both english and sign language. 
<br/>

**Areas of Interest**
<br/>

Take a look at some of the things I love working on.
<br/>

Image Processing
I apply real time semantic segmentation to detect human hands and transcribe sign language through supervised machine learning. 
<br/>

Natural Language Processing
I use transcribed sign language to further interpret and convert into smooth sentences by filling the gap between lines. 
<br/>

Cloud computing
I utilize AWS to develop and deploy machine learning systems equipped with image processing and/or natural language processing
<br/>

Data analytics
I love telling a story. Getting to the heart of a problem and coming up with a solution based on careful observations.
