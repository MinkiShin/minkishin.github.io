A data scientist and researcher. Inspired by real world problems. 
<br/>

My passion is working with hidden pattern recognition, data mining and visualization in order to develop software and hardware tools that help empower those in need. 
<br/>

I am looking to begin my undergraduate study in Applied Math and Statistics. I am excited about tackling new challenges with colleagues of new perspectives in a vibrant community.
