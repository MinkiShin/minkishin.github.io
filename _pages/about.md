A data scientist and researcher. Inspired by real world problems. 
<br/>

My passion is working with hidden pattern recognition, data mining and visualization in order to develop software and hardware tools that help empower those in need. 
<br/>

I am looking to begin my undergraduate study in Applied Math and Statistics. I am excited about tackling new challenges with colleagues of new perspectives in a vibrant community.
<br/>

# A Data Scientist


I am a self-learned expert in machine learning and big data analysis in various backgrounds including medical image, social media texts, and natural language in both english and sign language. 
<br/>

# Areas of Interest


Take a look at some of the things I love working on.
<br/>

**Image Processing**
<br/>
I apply real time semantic segmentation to detect human hands and transcribe sign language through supervised machine learning. 
<br/>

**Natural Language Processing**
<br/>
I use transcribed sign language to further interpret and convert into smooth sentences by filling the gap between lines. 
<br/>

**Cloud Computing**
<br/>
I utilize AWS to develop and deploy machine learning systems equipped with image processing and/or natural language processing
<br/>

**Data Analytics**
<br/>
I love telling a story. Getting to the heart of a problem and coming up with a solution based on careful observations.
